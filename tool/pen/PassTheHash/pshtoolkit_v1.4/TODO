=====================================================================================


TODO:

-Add support for windows 2000 for all tools (iam,whosthere,iam-alt,whosthere-alt)
-Improve Vista support for all tools (iam,whosthere,iam-alt,whosther-alt)
-Create a table detailing all supported platforms
-Make whosthere and whosthere-alt run in the background when the -i switch is used
-Change iam.exe to avoid executing code inside lsass.exe to change the credentials.
Use the whosthere.exe approach, where no code is executed inside lsass.exe to
get the credentials.
-Add support for other auth methods (kerberos, etc).. in the works..
-Fix bug when sometimes the credentials stored in memory by IAM get corrupted
-Add support for a switch similar to -i that will detect login attempts and
obtain credentials at that moment instead than every X amount of seconds
