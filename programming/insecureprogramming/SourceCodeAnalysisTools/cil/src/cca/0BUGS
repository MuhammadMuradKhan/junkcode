If you think you found a bug then look that it's
not because of some missing include directory, gcc flags
or similar. If this is not the case then set the debug level
in logger.ml to 'critical'.

        let debuglevel = critical

recompile the source and send me the full output of cilly together
with the analyzed source, if possible.
