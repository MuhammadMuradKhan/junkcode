C Code Checker 0.8
------------------

The C Code Checker (CCA) is a static analyzer for 
detecting potential security problems in C source code.


This analyzer was built with the following principles in mind:
- CCA tries to spot only the errors that can actually cause security problems. 
Not every strcpy is a problem.

- No code annotations or tweaking is required - it's fully automatic. It's not 
realistic that an auditor has to crawl through thousands of LOC telling the analyzer 
"watch this, watch that". It's possible to extend the set of dangerous functions, 
malloc wrappers etc, though.

- Seamless integration in existing development platforms. The Eclipse platform has 
been chosen as completion to the command line tool.


It should parse all GCC and MSVC code with no substantial problem. It has been run on
thousands of lines of code, including the linux kernel, tightvnc, ethereal, mplayer etc.


Current features are: 
        - fully automatic user input tracer <see USERINPUT>
        - memory leak detection
        - multiple/dangling free detection
        - array out of bound accesses
        - potential bufferoverflow detection 
        - format strings vulnerability detection
        - ... <ongoing development>
        - eclipse frontend plugin
