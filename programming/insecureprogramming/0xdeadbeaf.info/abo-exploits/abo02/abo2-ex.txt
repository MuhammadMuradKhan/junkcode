NOTE about abo2.c exploitation on different platforms

Exploitation of this program is not possible in x86 architectures: by supplying 
a buffer long enough it's easy to overwrite the return address of main(), but 
due to ineludable exit() it's practically impossible to gain control of the 
flow of the vulnerable program.

Phrack#58 contains an interesting paper (p58-0x0b) by <zhodiac@softhome.net>,
detailing exploitation on the HP-UX10.20/PA-RISC architecture, whose stack 
grows from lower address to higher address. It's then possible to overwrite the
return address of strcpy() and get control of the program flow before exit()
is executed.
